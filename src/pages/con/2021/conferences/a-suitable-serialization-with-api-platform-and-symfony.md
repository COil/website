# A suitable serialization with API Platform and Symfony

API Platform is built around **the serialization process**, which is the process of representing an object in a format that can be sent and persisted.

A strong dependency exists between API Platform and Symfony's Serializer component. Both of them are providing several technical solutions about object serialization. Groups, ContextBuilders, Serializers, DataTransformers, DTOs, Access controls... **So many available tools that are addressing specific needs**. Some of them are easy to implement, others are powerful. But, how to choose the adapted technical solution according to its needs?

During this talk, we will cover some technical solutions and we will focus on the needs they try to address in order to use them wisely.
