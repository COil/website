# French tech & Start up Nation, what else?

This is a little ethico-practical questioning on **the future of digital technology**. I'd like to talk about the questions that are bothering me about our responsibility but also our capacity to act on the tools and services we create every day.

What if, **together**, we had more power than it seems?
